Possibly caused by overflow on item (ttato S1E2)?!

Possibly linked to the incorporation of elements into <itunes:image> tag (which shouldn't happen).
This itself seems to be caused by a space somehow ending a tag (shouldn't happen) and thus causing the end of the tag to be treated as a new STAG!
This results in the following debug output.
```
Found element "itunes:image"[4]
Double Quotes turned to 1
Double Quotes turned to 0
Attribute [of 'itunes:image'] 'href' = 'https://deow9bq0xqvbj.cloudfront.net/image-logo/3171093/JWJBGHsm.jpg'
[5]Found element ""
End of element "".
STAG: ''
[5]Found element "image"
``` 
Also, why is the '[4]' at the end?  It should always be at the beginning!!!
