# Debug Output for Subscribe and Download Latest of a BBC Podcast
This is the Debug output for the "subscribe and download latest" command 
(`scpod subscribe 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p004t1hd/episodes/downloads.rss' download latest`)
for a BBC Podcast.  This command successfully subscribed to the podcast and
downloaded the latest episode.

The podcast in question is "Witness", an excellent BBC series.  I highly 
recommend it.

In April 1987, Princess Diana opened the UK's first purpose built HIV Aids unit at London Middlesex Hospital that exclusively cared for patients infected with the virus. In front of the world's media, without wearing gloves, Princess Diana shook the hand of a man suffering with the illness. This gesture publicly challenged the notion that HIV Aids was passed from person to person by touch. John O'Reilly was a nurse on the ward at the time of the Princess of Wales' visit. He spoke to Farhana Haider about the landmark moment in the fight against HIV Aids.

Ramon Ojeda Mestre is an environmentalist who was behind the initiative, introduced in November 1989. He tells Mike Lanchin about overcoming fierce opposition to the plan, and how some critics even predicted riots from irate motorists.

Rebecca Kesby has been speaking to Corinne Cowell, an eye witness to the first killing, and biologist Eric Walters, the whale trainer who warned the authorities 2 years before that keeping orcas in captivity could be fatal.

In response, the UN set up a refugee camp complex at Dadaab, in a remote part of Eastern Kenya. It became the largest refugee camp in the world. At its height Dadaab was home to 500,000 refugees, most of them Somalis.  But the Kenyan government has now announced that it will close down the camp and return the refugees to Somalia. 

We hear the story of Zamzam Abdi Gelle, a young woman who arrived in Dadaab 25 years ago, after her family was attacked in war torn Somalia.

Element data: "Albania was hit by a wave of violent unrest in January 1997 after the collapse of 'pyramid' investment schemes. At least two-thirds of the population had invested in the get-rich-quick schemes. Demonstrators took to the streets calling for the resignation of the Albanian President Sali Berisha. Soon protesters were clashing with armed police. Monica Whitlock speaks to Lorina Naci who was a schoolgirl in Tirana at the time.

It's estimated that across the whole of Africa between 70 and 85 per cent of all food is grown by women, but less than 2 per cent of the land is owned or even controlled by women. Helping women with farming tips and business ideas and supporting women evicted from their land, Sizani's movement has grown over the years, and now has more than 50,000 members nationwide. "I'm a trouble-maker" is how she describes herself to Rebecca Kesby.

Element data: "After India's traumatic Partition Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru persuaded the maverick Swiss-French architect, Le Corbusier, to help reinvent a newly independent India by building a new capital city for the province of Punjab.



Le Corbusier had revolutionised architecture and urban planning in the first half of the twentieth century. He was loved and hated in equal measure for his modernist approach, favouring flat roofs, glass walls and concrete.



Nehru said this new city would be "symbolic of the freedom of India, unfettered by the traditions of the past". 



Starting in 1950 the city of Chandigarh was built from scratch on farmland and is unlike any other city in India. The broad boulevards, pedestrianised plazas and green spaces were designed to encourage a feeling of order and of being close to nature.



Claire Bowes spoke to Sumit Kaur, former Chief Architect and lifelong resident of Chandigarh, about the personal legacy left by Le Corbusier.

But that began to change in the aftermath of World War One. The Greek army occupied Smyrna and its surroundings and was responsible for atrocities against Turks. Then in September 1922, Turkish forces routed the Greek army and re-entered the city. They began a campaign of rape, murder and looting mainly targeted at Armenians and Greeks. Within days the city was ablaze. 



Rob Walker has been speaking to Jacques Nalbantian, who was five years old when the fire broke out, and to the historian Giles Milton.

For years many on the left had been sceptical of the EC, regarding it as a 'rich man's club'. The Labour party and the unions had even called for withdrawal of the European Community, but as Europe geared up for the opening of the single market in 1992 Jacques Delors began to talk about something new, it was called the social dimension and one TUC official, David Lea, wanted to know more, so he invited him to Britain's Trades Union Congress.  Claire Bowes spoke to Lord Lea along with John Edmonds, formerly of the GMB union.

Element data: "In September 1988, Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission convinced British trade unionists to support Europe.  For years many on the left had been sceptical of the EC, regarding it as a 'rich man's club'. The Labour party and the unions had even called for withdrawal of the European Community, but as Europe geared up for the opening of the single market in 1992 Jacques Delors began to talk about something new, it was called the social dimension and one TUC official, David Lea, wanted to know more, so he invited him to Britain's Trades Union Congress.  Claire Bowes spoke to Lord Lea along with John Edmonds, formerly of the GMB union.

Element data: "Emperor Tewodros II is one of the towering figures of modern Ethiopian history. He tried to unify and modernise Ethiopia. But his reign was also marked by brutality. 

He faced a rising tide of rebellion inside the country and then in 1868 a British military expedition marched into the Ethiopian highlands. Their aim was to free British diplomatic envoys the Emperor had imprisoned. 

Tewodros II made a last stand at Magdala, his mountain top fortress.

It was the first major foot-and-mouth outbreak in Britain for more than 30 years.
